spark-examples
==============

This repository was created to house a number of Spark Machine Learning examples. It is for public use.

The various runners can be initialized individually through sbt or IntelliJ, while `sbt run` will by default initialize the LogisticRegression Runner.

What do I need to run the code in this repository?
==================================================

This repository was designed for ease of use using sbt. The only thing you need is sbt itself. Please reference `http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html` to install `sbt`.
